OpenMRSÂ® is a community-developed, open-source, enterprise electronic medical
record system framework. See http://openmrs.org/wiki/OpenMRS for more info.

This project aims to simplify working with the complex OpenMRS data model in
Rails applications by accomplishing the following goals:

1. Automation of database migrations to create tables according to the latest
OpenMRS Data Model release.

2. Generation of subsequent models in ActiveRecord complete with primary and
foreign key specification, association definitions.

3. Methods in each model where appropriate to faciliate working with data in
the most generic way possible.

Note: this is a work in progress under active development and is NOT ready for
prime time yet!
